These notes are based on information pulled from the [Rust Async Book](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/).

# What is it
"It lets you run a large number of concurrent tasks on a small number of OS threads, while preserving much of the look and feel of ordinary synchronous programming, through the `async/await` syntax" - Why Async?

## Aync Functions
"Inside an `async fn`, you can use `.await` to wait for the completion of another type that implements the `Future` trait" - [book](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/01_getting_started/04_async_await_primer.html)




# Rust Implementations
There are no built-in runtimes. Instead, they are provided by community maintained crates.
